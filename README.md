# Projects
A few of my academic projects:

stats_capstone is a project using bootstrap sampling to compare different methods of assessing bioequivalence of topical drugs.

applied_regression is a project using linear regression to examine the relationship between obesity and other neighborhood-level characteristics in Denver, based on Census data. I was especially curious to see if there was a relationship between the number of health food grocery stores in neighborhoods and the level of obesity.

generalized_linear_models uses logistic regression to estimate whether residents in a Vermont town would vote to close schools in relation to possible chemical contamination of water resources.

bayesian_statistics uses data from the US Census Household Pulse Survey collected during the COVID-19 pandemic to examine the CODID-related issues that are most associated with higher levels of depression among Colorado residents.
